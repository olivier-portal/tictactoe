"""
    The main() function stocks the principal functions in variables in order to call them at the end
    This function also allows you to keep in buffer the variables which will be used as arguments in another function 
    
    Example: The define-player() function defines the name of the 2 players, it returns the name of player 1 in the variable player1
             and the name of player 2 in the variable player2
             the player1 and player2 variables are stored and used as arguments in the symbol allocation function (X or O)
             => sym(player1, player2)
